# OPSAgent

OPSAgent is a skeleton project for an operations diagnosis agent written in Go. The
project is inspired by the "OPS Agent 思维链条" design which describes a
five step approach to locate and explain production issues.

This repository contains minimal placeholder code to bootstrap the future
implementation. The goal of this version is to provide an initial structure
that will be expanded with real logic using the Gong Codex DSL and Go
implementations.

## Module Layout

```

## Building

The project uses Go modules. To build the main binary:

```bash
$ go build -o opsagent
```

The generated executable currently performs no real analysis; all modules
contain placeholder implementations.

Additional documentation can be found in the [`docs/`](docs) directory.
